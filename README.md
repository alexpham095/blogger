# README

This is a repo to record my progress through the [Jumpstart Lab's blog tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html). This is a part of [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/ruby-on-rails) 

I am using Ruby version 2.5.1 and Rails 5.2.1.

Future goals:
1. Redesign CSS to my style profile
2. Waiting for update for login. As of right now, I have compatibility issues with Sorcery.
